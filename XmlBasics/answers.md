##  1. What does the XML language represents? What is it used for? 

XML stands for Extensible Markup Language. It defines rules for encoding documents in a specific text-based format. 
The latter is not only machine-readable, but it is also human-readable. XML provides a way to store and transmit 
information, to describe and identify information accurately and unambiguously. It separates form from content.

##  2. Create XML document students.xml, which contains structured description of students.
*   For each student you should enter information for his name, sex, birth date, phone, email, course, specialty, 
faculty number and a list of taken exams (exam name, tutor, score).

See students.xml

##  3.  What do the namespaces represent in the XML documents? What are they used for? 

The namespaces in XML provide a way to identify which vocabulary, or set of names, is being used in a document. The name
of a namespace must follow the syntax for URI(Uniform Resource Identifier). Also, it should be unique.

##  4. Explore http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Resource_Identifier to learn more about URI, URN and URL definitions.

Done.

##  5. Add default namespace for the students "urn:students".

See students.xml

##  6. Create XSD Schema for the students.xml document.

See students.xsd

##  7. Write a XSL stylesheet to visualize the students as HTML.

See students.xsl
